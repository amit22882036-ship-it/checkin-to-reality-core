## 🎯 Project Overview

This project analyzes the gap between hotel expectations (what hotels claim/promise) and reality (what guests actually experience). Using data from Booking.com, OpenStreetMap, Google Maps, and crime statistics, we build a machine learning model to predict actual hotel quality and identify "overrated" properties.

> **💡 Key Innovation**: By combining spatial analysis (nearby POIs, noise sources, transit) with NLP sentiment analysis of guest reviews, we detect hotels that may disappoint guests despite high ratings.

## 📚 Notebook Documentation

## 1️⃣ Booking.ipynb

### 🎯 Purpose
Loads, cleans, and processes Booking.com hotel data to extract structured features.

### What It Does
1. **Data Loading & Standardization**
   - Reads hotel data from Azure Blob Storage (parquet format)
   - Filters to 10 target cities
   - **City Name Standardization**: Implements keyword mapping to unify inconsistent city names
     - Example: "NYC", "Bronx", "Brooklyn" → unified as "New York"
     - Ensures data integrity across geographic variations

2. **Geographic Validation & Geofiltering**
   - **Haversine Distance Filter**: Calculates distance of each listing from respective city center
   - **Spatial Outlier Removal**: Removes listings beyond defined city buffer
     - Filters erroneous entries (e.g., locations named "Rome" situated in USA)
     - City-specific radius thresholds (larger cities = larger buffer)
   - Validates coordinate accuracy
   - Result: Clean dataset relevant only to 10 target cities

3. **Feature Extraction**
   - **Amenities**: Parses `most_popular_facilities` field using predefined dictionary to transform amenity lists into Boolean vectors (e.g., has_wifi, has_pool) - 18 amenity types total
   - **House Rules**: Applies Regex to unstructured house rules to extract:
     - Structured numeric data (check-in/out times)
     - Categorical policies (pets allowed, smoking rules, quiet hours)
   - **Property Surroundings**: Number and distance of nearby POIs
   - **Claims Extraction (Expectation Modeling)**: Core component quantifying "host's promise"
     - Text mining module scans description, highlights, and title fields
     - Detects "Claims Keywords" for location and atmosphere (e.g., "central", "quiet", "spacious", "luxury")
     - Generates Claims Features (claims_luxury, claims_central, claims_quiet, etc.)
     - Serves as baseline for "Expectation vs. Reality" analysis
   - **Reviews**: Aggregates review text, reviewer countries

4. **Data Quality**
   - Handles null values
   - Converts complex nested structures to flat columns
   - Validates data types

### Output
- **Silver Layer**: `dbfs:/FileStore/project/silver/booking_parsed`
- **Columns**: 56 structured features per hotel
- **Format**: Parquet, partitioned by city

### Key Statistics
- Total hotels: 62,643
- Hotels with reviews: ~60,000
- Average amenities per hotel: 8-12
- Review coverage: 94% of hotels have text reviews

### How to Run
```python
# Prerequisites
# - Access to Azure Blob Storage with SAS token
# - Databricks cluster with PySpark

# Simply run all cells in order
# The notebook handles data loading, transformation, and saving automatically
```

## 3️⃣ spatial_joins_NLP.ipynb

### 🎯 Purpose
The core analytics notebook that combines spatial analysis and NLP to detect gaps between hotel promises and reality.

### What It Does

#### Part A: Spatial Joins

**Efficient Joining via Geohashing**

A naive distance calculation between every hotel and POI would result in a prohibitive Cartesian product (~70,000 hotels × 180,000 POIs ≈ 12.6 billion comparisons). To solve this computational bottleneck, we implemented a **Geohash-based blocking strategy**:

1. **Geospatial Indexing**
   - Assigns precision-based Geohash strings to hotels and POIs
   - Partitions the world into manageable grid cells
   - Reduces the problem from global search to local bucket search

2. **Neighbor Explosion Technique**
   - Replicates each hotel record to associate with its own Geohash cell
   - Also associates with 8 surrounding neighbor cells
   - Prevents missing POIs located just across grid cell borders
   - This "neighbor explosion" ensures comprehensive coverage

2. **OSM Spatial Join**
   - Counts POIs within various radii (300m, 500m, 1km)
   - **Nightlife counts** (500m radius) - noise indicator
   - **Transport proximity** (nearest station/stop)
   - **Restaurant density** (300m, 500m)
   - **Parks and leisure** (500m, nearest park)
   - **Tourist attractions** (1km)

3. **Google Maps Spatial Join**
   - Aggregates GMaps ratings around each hotel
   - **Average noise score** within 500m
   - **Average restaurant rating** within 500m
   - **Neighborhood quality score**
   - **Vibe indicators**: Tourist traps, local favorites, sketchy areas
   - Counts high-rated establishments nearby

4. **Key Metrics Calculated**
   - `nightlife_count_500m`: Number of bars/clubs nearby (noise risk)
   - `noise_sources_500m`: Major roads + nightlife
   - `nearest_transport_m`: Distance to metro/train
   - `avg_noise_score_500m`: Average noise level from GMaps reviews
   - `high_rated_restaurants_500m`: Quality dining options
   - `tourist_trap_pois_500m`: Tourist trap density

#### Part B: NLP Analysis - Hybrid Dual-Layer Pipeline

This notebook implements a **Hybrid NLP Pipeline** combining rule-based extraction with semantic sentiment analysis to capture both specific complaints and general sentiment nuances:

**Layer 1: Rule-Based Extraction**
1. **Review Text Processing**
   - Loads review text from all hotels
   - Cleans and normalizes text (lowercase, remove special chars)
   - Applies complex Regex patterns to detect specific complaint categories

2. **Keyword-Based Complaint Detection**
   - **Noise complaints**: "loud", "noisy", "party", "music"
   - **Cleanliness complaints**: "dirty", "stain", "smell", "mold"
   - **Location complaints**: "far from", "inconvenient", "middle of nowhere"
   - **Amenities complaints**: "broken", "missing", "not working"
   - **Host complaints**: "rude", "unhelpful", "unresponsive"
   - **Value complaints**: "overpriced", "not worth", "expensive"

3. **Praise Detection**
   - **Quiet praise**: "quiet", "peaceful", "tranquil"
   - **Cleanliness praise**: "spotless", "immaculate", "clean"
   - **Location praise**: "perfect location", "convenient", "central"
   - **Amenities praise**: "great amenities", "well-equipped"
   - **Host praise**: "friendly", "helpful", "attentive"
   - **Value praise**: "great value", "affordable", "worth it"

4. **Sentiment Analysis (Layer 2: Semantic Analysis)**
   - Uses **Spark NLP's BERT-based pipeline** (Universal Sentence Encoder)
   - Generates `bert_sentiment_score` for sophisticated emotional tone understanding
   - Calculates **sentiment polarity** (-1 to +1)
   - Calculates **sentiment intensity** (strength of emotion)
   - Creates **complaint ratio** (complaints / total sentiment words)
   - Captures nuances missed by simple keyword counting

5. **Gap Signal Detection - Core Innovation**

A key innovation is the engineering of **"Gap Signals"** - features quantifying contradictions between host promises and guest realities:

   - **Noise Gap Example**: Flags discrepancies where hotel metadata claims "quiet" or "soundproof", yet NLP detects high frequency of noise-related complaints
   - **bert_score_gap**: Difference between normalized review score (0-1) and BERT sentiment score - indicates when users give high ratings but write negative reviews (social pressure effect)

**Gap Indicators Created**
   - `sentiment_gap`: Difference between review score and sentiment
   - `noise_gap_signal`: Claims quiet but has noise complaints
   - `cleanliness_gap_signal`: Claims clean but has cleanliness complaints
   - `location_gap_signal`: Claims central but guests say it's far
   - `amenity_gap_signal`: Claims amenities but guests report issues

### Output
- **Gold Layer**: `dbfs:/FileStore/project/gold/hotel_with_sentiment`
- **Features**: ~150 columns including:
  - All original hotel features
  - 17 spatial features from OSM
  - 17 spatial features from Google Maps
  - 34 NLP-derived features (complaints, praises, sentiment)
  - Gap indicators

### How to Run
```python
# Prerequisites
# - Completed notebooks 1 and 2
# - Data in silver layer:
#   - booking_parsed
#   - osm_clean
#   - gmaps_clean

# Runtime: ~15-20 minutes 
# - Spatial joins are computationally expensive
# - NLP processing requires iteration over all reviews
```

## 4️⃣ randomforest.ipynb

### 🎯 Purpose
Builds a machine learning model to predict "reality scores" and calculate the gap between expectations and actual guest experience.

### What It Does

#### Part A: Data Preparation
1. **Feature Selection**
   - **Expectation Features** (34): Claims, amenities, policies
   - **Spatial Features** (34): OSM + Google Maps POI data
   - **NLP Features** (34): Complaints, praises, sentiment
   - **Crime Features** (15): City-level safety metrics
   - **Other** (3): Review counts, diversity metrics
   - **Total**: 120 features

2. **Data Processing**
   - Joins hotel data with crime statistics by city
   - Converts boolean features to numeric (0/1)
   - Fills missing values with 0
   - Assembles feature vector using VectorAssembler

3. **Train/Test Split**
   - 80% training (18,484 hotels)
   - 20% testing (4,504 hotels)
   - Stratified by city to ensure balanced representation

#### Part B: Model Training

**Model Selection: Gradient Boosted Trees (GBT) vs Random Forest**

We experimented with multiple ensemble methods to predict actual hotel quality:

1. **Random Forest Model (Baseline)**
   - 100 trees, max depth 10
   - **Approach**: Parallel bagging (trains trees independently)
   - **Performance**:
     - Test RMSE: 1.179
     - Test R²: 0.723
     - Test MAE: 0.792

2. **Gradient Boosted Trees (GBT) - Selected Model**
   - 50 iterations, max depth 10
   - **Approach**: Sequential boosting (each tree corrects errors from previous trees)
   - **Why GBT?**: GBT's boosting mechanism proved more effective at capturing subtle, non-linear patterns in our data
   - **Final Performance**:
     - **Test RMSE: 0.839** (average error ~0.8 points on 10-point scale)
     - **Test R²: 0.873** (explains 87.3% of variance in hotel scores)
     - **Test MAE: 0.484** (average absolute error 0.48 points)

   **Interpretation**: An R² of 0.873 indicates strong predictive power. The model's predictions deviate from actual ratings by less than 0.9 points on average - highly acceptable for this domain.

3. **Model Architecture**
   - High-dimensional feature space: ~150 features total
   - Features assembled using Spark's VectorAssembler
   - Three data layers integrated:
     - **Expectation Features**: Quantified host claims
     - **Spatial Reality**: OSM & Google Maps geospatial metrics
     - **NLP Signals**: Sentiment scores and complaint/praise ratios

#### Part C: Gap Score Calculation
1. **Reality Prediction**
   - Applies GBT model to ALL hotels
   - Predicts "reality score" based on spatial + NLP features

2. **Gap Calculation**
   ```
   gap_score = review_score - predicted_reality_score

   Positive gap = Overrated (disappointing)
   Negative gap = Underrated (exceeds expectations)
   ```

3. **Risk Categorization**
   - **High Risk** (gap > 1.5): Likely to disappoint
   - **Medium Risk** (gap 0.5-1.5): Some concerns
   - **As Expected** (gap -0.5 to 0.5): Reliable
   - **Better Than Expected** (gap -1.5 to -0.5): Pleasant surprise
   - **Hidden Gem** (gap < -1.5): Much better than expected

#### Part D: Feature Importance Analysis

**Why GBT for Interpretability**: A primary reason for selecting GBT was its interpretability via feature importance scores, revealing clear patterns in guest satisfaction.

**Top Drivers of Hotel Scores**:

1. **`number_of_reviews` (~26% importance)** - The strongest single predictor
   - Indicates "Wisdom of the Crowd" effect
   - Established, frequently reviewed hotels maintain consistent scores
   - Social proof is the dominant quality signal

2. **Spatial Features (~30.6% combined)** - Location quality matters most
   - `distance_from_center_km` (3.5%) - Convenience and accessibility
   - `nearest_transport_m` (2.9%) - Transit proximity
   - Confirms that location drives satisfaction

3. **Expectation Features (~17.4% combined)** - What hotels claim
   - `amenities_count` (3.2%) - Hotels with more services score higher
   - Validates that variety of offerings matters

4. **NLP Features (~8.6% combined)** - Actual guest experience
   - `sentiment_score_adjusted` and `positive_word_count` in top 20
   - Confirms NLP-derived signals align with numerical ratings
   - Contributes meaningfully despite structural features dominating

5. **Crime Features (~7.7% combined)** - City safety impacts satisfaction
   - City-level safety metrics influence overall experience

**Key Insight**: While complex spatial and NLP features add value, simple signals of "trust" and "social proof" (review volume) remain the dominant predictors in hospitality.

#### Part E: Output for Web App
1. **Creates Final Dataset** (`hotel_webapp`)
   - 22,988 hotels with complete data
   - 54 columns optimized for frontend display
   - Includes:
     - Gap score and risk level
     - Trust badge ("Hidden Gem", "Overhyped", etc.)
     - Top complaints and praises
     - Key amenities and location features
     - Neighborhood quality metrics

2. **Export Formats**
   - Parquet: `dbfs:/FileStore/project/gold/hotel_webapp`
   - CSV: `/FileStore/tables/hotel_webapp.csv`

### Key Insights from Model
- **Most overrated cities**: Analyze `avg_gap_score` by city
- **Hidden gems**: Hotels with gap_score < -1.5
- **Tourist traps**: Hotels with gap_score > 1.5
- **Feature importance**: What actually matters for satisfaction

### How to Run
```python
# Prerequisites
# - Completed notebook 3
# - Data in gold layer: hotel_with_sentiment

# Runtime: ~10-15 minutes

## ⚠️ Limitations and Reflections

While the model demonstrates high predictive power (R² = 0.873), several limitations constrained the approach and offer avenues for future work:

### 🌐 Data Collection Scalability & Coverage

> **⚡ Challenge**: The most significant challenge was integrating proprietary external data. Due to strict anti-bot measures and aggressive rate-limiting:
- Google Maps enrichment covers only **7 of 10 target cities**
- TripAdvisor scraping was abandoned due to scalability issues

**Impact**: Model performance might vary across different geographies. A fully deployed production system would require official enterprise APIs rather than web scraping.

💡 **Solution Used**: Developed custom multi-threaded scraper with proxy rotation (200k proxies filtered to ~300 high-quality), but still faced constraints.

### 📍 Geospatial Approximations

> **⚡ Challenge**: Spatial analysis relies on **Haversine distance** (Euclidean "as-the-crow-flies" distance) to calculate POI proximity.

**⚠️ Limitation**: In dense urban environments (Tokyo, New York), this doesn't reflect true walking distance due to:
- Physical barriers (highways, rivers)
- Lack of pedestrian crossings
- Complex urban layouts

📊 **Impact**: "Convenience" features (e.g., `dist_to_subway`) are approximations that might over-optimistically assess a hotel's location.

### ⏰ Temporal Dynamics & Seasonality

> **⚡ Challenge**: Dataset represents a static snapshot in time.

**🔍 Missing Factors**:
- Seasonality effects (summer festivals, tourist seasons)
- Temporary construction noise
- Evolving neighborhoods
- Review timestamps not accounted for

📉 **Impact**: Model doesn't capture transient trends affecting guest satisfaction. A "quiet" neighborhood might be noisy during peak seasons.

### 💡 Key Learnings

| # | Learning | Insight |
|---|----------|---------|
| 1️⃣ | **Data Engineering > Modeling** | Initially underestimated computational cost of spatial joins. The "Cartesian Explosion" forced innovation with Geohashing strategies. |
| 2️⃣ | **External Enrichment is Powerful but Noisy** | Aligning vague hotel addresses with precise OSM coordinates required robust cleaning logic. |
| 3️⃣ | **Simple Signals Win** | Despite complex spatial/NLP features, `number_of_reviews` (social proof) remains strongest predictor. |
| 4️⃣ | **Real-World Trade-offs** | Data science involves balancing ideal coverage with practical constraints (rate limits, scraping, API costs). |
